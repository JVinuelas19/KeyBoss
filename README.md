# KeyBoss

KeyBoss is a GUI password generator/tester done with CustomTkInter. You can use it to check if your passwords are in the green or generate a secure one. 
Thanks to Tech With Tim (https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) and Hive Systems (hivesystems.io) for the inspiration!
Due to executable weights i can't upload the .exe file. For a complete experience download the assets.zip and put the content in the same path that key_boss.py
Otherwise time charts will not show up and you will not get a full user experience.

# KeyBoss main features:
- Generates passwords based on user's criteria: users can add numbers, symbols, uppercase and lowercase letters. Choose a length and pressing GENERATE will return a password, its MD5 hash and cracking time based on current brute-force hardware.
- Tests your passwords: Users can enter them passwords to test how secure they are based on length, character composition and selected brute-force hardware.
- Time charts included: You can check anytime the hardware time charts pressing the 'Show Hardware Chart' button.
- Data source link: You can learn more about password security pressing the 'How can you know this?' button.
- Configuration menu containing an app theme selector: choose between light or dark theme.
- Help menu with a tutorial in case user does not understand the purpose of the app.
- Who did this? menu to let users know more about me and give them social media and GitHub credits.
- An easter egg explaining what happened with the md5_hash.py file. If you find it please let me know!
